    "prompt": "You are a PROFESSIONAL FILM DIRECTOR planning a short dramatic film.\n\nFILM BRIEF:\nTITLE: \"The Rickshaw Accident\"\nSCENARIO: Late afternoon on Shahrah-e-Faisal near Karachi Airport. Rush hour traffic. Hot and humid. A rickshaw and a car have collided, both drivers blaming each other. Horns honking, crowd gathering. Traffic police known to ask for bribe. Everyone wants this over fast but for different reasons.\n\nCAST:\n  • Saleem: Poor rickshaw driver, sole earner for family of 5. Speaks Urdu-English mix, uses 'bhai' and 'yaar'. Panicked and defensive after minor accident with expensive car.\n  • Ahmed Malik: Wealthy car owner and businessman, late for an international flight. Impatient, entitled. Speaks formally but stressed about missing his flight and the damage to his expensive sedan.\n  • Constable Raza: 15-year traffic police veteran, underpaid and cynical. Just wants to clear traffic and maybe get a 'facilitation fee'. Sees this as everyday nuisance.\n  • Uncle Jameel: Local shopkeeper who witnessed everything. Nosy, loves drama, gives unsolicited advice in thick Urdu accent. Claims to know 'someone in police'.\n\nTOTAL TURNS: 10\nMINIMUM PHYSICAL ACTIONS: 2 (must be different action types)\n\nPLANNING TASK:\nPlan the COMPLETE dramatic arc for this 10-turn film.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n• SETUP (first ~20% of turns): Introduce the conflict, establish characters\n  and the world. Open with narration setting the scene, then first dialogue.\n• CONFLICT (middle ~50% of turns): Escalate tension, create confrontations,\n  reveal stakes. Characters clash. Physical actions happen here.\n• RESOLUTION (final ~30% of turns): Climax and denouement. Reach a\n  meaningful conclusion. Final turn should have closing narration.\n\nRULES:\n1. The story MUST conclude by turn 10 — plan the ending.\n2. At least 2 physical actions must occur (different types).\n3. Turn 0 should be opening narration (no dialogue).\n4. The final turn should include concluding narration.\n5. Every character should speak at least once.\n6. The pacing must feel natural for a 10-turn story.\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON:\n\n{\n  \"arc_plan\": [\n    {\n      \"turn\": 0,\n      \"phase\": \"setup\",\n      \"type\": \"narration\",\n      \"beat\": \"Opening — set the scene\",\n      \"suggested_speaker\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"turn\": 1,\n      \"phase\": \"setup\",\n      \"type\": \"dialogue\",\n      \"beat\": \"First character breaks the silence\",\n      \"suggested_speaker\": \"Character Name\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"conclusion_type\": \"How the story should naturally end (1 sentence)\"\n}",
