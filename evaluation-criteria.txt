Evaluation Criteria 
Component Excellent / Full Marks Partial / Poor Performance 
GitHub Repository 
& Working System 
(25 marks) 
● System runs successfully 
using the provided 
instructions.  
● Repository is 
well-structured and code 
is clean, modular, and 
readable. 
● Repository exists but is 
poorly organized, difficult 
to run.  
● The system is partially or 
fully non-functional. 
JSON Files 
Compliance 
(15 marks) 
● All required input and 
output JSON files strictly 
follow the problem 
statement. 
● Fields are complete, 
meaningful, and 
consistent with the 
narrative flow. 
● Missing, malformed, or 
inconsistent JSON files. 
● Output does not 
accurately reflect the 
system execution. 
Feature 
Implementation 
Beyond Base 
Design 
(15 marks) 
● Implements all required 
functionality and 
introduces meaningful 
extensions beyond the 
starter kit, such as 
actions, memory, or 
improved reasoning. 
● Features are stable and 
well-integrated. 
● Limited or incorrect 
feature implementation. 
● Little or no improvement 
beyond the provided base 
design. 
Documentation & 
Report 
● Clear README with 
setup and usage 
● Incomplete or unclear 
documentation. 
(20 marks) instructions. Design 
report explains what was 
built, why design 
decisions were made, 
and how the system 
works. 
● Demonstrates originality 
with minimal reliance on 
AI-generated content. 
● Design decisions are 
poorly justified or heavily 
AI-generated without 
understanding. 
Q/A Session with 
Judges 
(15 marks) 
● Demonstrates strong 
understanding of the 
system architecture, 
agent interactions, and 
design choices. 
● Provides clear justification 
for implementation 
decisions. 
● Unable to clearly explain 
the system or justify 
design decisions. 
Story Narration 
Quality 
(10 marks) 
● Narrative is coherent, 
engaging, and logically 
structured. Director 
narration and agent 
interactions contribute 
meaningfully to story 
progression. 
● Evaluation is subjective 
and accompanied by 
judge comments. 
● Narration lacks 
coherence or clarity. Story 
progression is weak or 
difficult to follow. 
 
Note: Story Narration Quality is evaluated subjectively. Judges are expected to provide brief 
written comments to justify the awarded score.
