    "description": "Late night at Jinnah International Airport, Karachi. Heavy rain has delayed all flights. A girl is leaving for Canada for good. Her ex-boyfriend shows up just to “return her book.” Flight keeps getting delayed. Boarding announcements echo. Her family is nearby. His best friend accidentally reveals he still loves her. She thinks he moved on. He thinks she’s engaged. Neither knows the full truth. Time is running out."
